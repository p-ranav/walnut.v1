Walnut is an interpreted high-level programming language implemented in C++. Walnut is simple, elegant and inspired by concepts in a number of programming languages including Python, Go, Rust and Javascript. This project is very much a work in progress and a learning experience, as I explore the world of language interpreters. 

* Lexer with UTF-8 support
* Recursive-descent Parser
* Tree-walking Interpreter

This code base has been tested with both Visual Studio 2017 and gcc 7.3.0. 

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../.
$ make && make check
```
